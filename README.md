## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Click dice btn in order to receive a new advice

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I am relatively still new to a mobile first approach and this has been a good experience on how to structure my code for these types of workflows.

### Continued development

I would like to go further into API's and using more complex data - as I feel it would be a good challenge and learning experience.
