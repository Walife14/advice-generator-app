### Links

- Live Site URL: (https://walife14.github.io/advice-generator-app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I am relatively still new to a mobile first approach and this has been a good experience on how to structure my code for these types of workflows.

### Continued development

I would like to go further into API's and using more complex data - as I feel it would be a good challenge and learning experience.
